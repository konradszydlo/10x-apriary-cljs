# AI Rules for 

Apriary Application

Apriary Summary is an MVP web application designed to automate the process of creating summaries of apiary work. The application is aimed at owners of small apiaries who need a quick and efficient way to document the history of work performed on hives.

## Tech Stack

- Biff
- Clojure 1.12
- XTDB 1.24
- Tailwind 4

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./src` - source code
- `./src/com/apriary/pages` - Biff pages
- `./src/com/apriary/middleware.clj` - Biff middleware
- `./src/com//apriary/schema.clj` - XTDB schema definitions
- `./resources/public` - public assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from clj-kondo linter to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use when pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types for consistent error handling.

## Frontend

### General Guidelines

Use htmx for interactivity and dynamic content loading.

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Backend and Database

- Use XTDB for database service
- Use Malli schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- use `parse-uuid` to parse UUID strings into UUID objects.
- Use `:db/doc-type` attribute in XTDB schema to define document types
- Use `:db/op` like `:delete`, `:update` for database operations

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 1

Bootstrap a greenfield project end-to-end with the **shaping chain**:

```
/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  (10x-tech-stack-selector)  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The first three skills ship in this lesson; the last two are the next links in the chain.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Project setup** | |
| `/10x-init` | The project directory is fresh. Scaffolds `context/foundation/lessons.md` and `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` so the rest of the workflow has somewhere to write. Run this once per project. |
| **Discovery** | |
| `/10x-shape` | You have an idea and need to turn it into structured shape-notes BEFORE writing a PRD. Greenfield only. Walks vision → persona/access → MVP → FRs (with Socratic challenge) → business logic & data → stack-openness sketch. Surfaces empty-CRUD and MVP-too-big anti-patterns by name. Output: `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with a resumable `checkpoint:` block. |
| **Document generation** | |
| `/10x-prd` | You have shape-notes (or raw notes) and want a schema-conformant `context/foundation/prd.md`. Generates against the locked schema, routes every gap verbatim into `## Open Questions`, and refuses to invent domain decisions. On collision, prompts overwrite vs. versioned save (`prd-vN.md`). |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-init` produces the workflow v2 scaffold (`context/foundation/`, `lessons.md`, `contract-surfaces.md`). `/10x-shape` requires this and will offer to delegate to `/10x-init` if it's missing.
- `/10x-shape` writes `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with frontmatter `checkpoint:` (current_phase, phases_completed, frs_drafted, quality_check_status). On re-entry, it resumes from the next unfinished phase.
- `/10x-prd` reads `shape-notes.md` (default) or any path you pass, scores the input on a 4-signal heuristic, warns on thin input, and writes `context/foundation/prd.md` against the schema at `skills/10x-shape/references/prd-schema.md` (frontmatter aligned 1:1 with 10x-tech-stack-selector's Q1–Q7).

### What the PRD captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: vision, persona, success criteria, user stories (Given/When/Then), FRs (FR-NNN), NFRs, business logic (one-sentence rule first), data model, access control, durable implementation decisions, testing strategy, deployment & CI/CD strategy, non-goals, open questions.
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: framework choices, database choices, file paths, deployment platform. Stack openness is binding — only `product_type` and `tech_preferences.language_family` capture stack-shaped intent. Frameworks are 10x-tech-stack-selector's job.

### Anti-patterns surfaced during shaping

- **Empty-CRUD**: business logic that reduces to "users add and remove records" with no domain rule. `/10x-shape` names it explicitly and prompts for a real rule shape (recommendation, prioritization, classification, validation, scoring, workflow, calculation).
- **MVP-too-big**: first-flow estimate exceeds ~1 week of after-hours work, or > 4 distinct user actions before user-visible value, or requires multiple integrations before payoff. Skill names the expensive pieces and offers concrete scope-down moves.

Both are **soft gates**: they warn but allow override. Overrides are recorded in the checkpoint and surfaced in the PRD's `## Open Questions`.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` — `/10x-shape` output
- `context/foundation/prd.md` (or `prd-vN.md`) — `/10x-prd` output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)

### Universal language

The shipped skills carry no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The mechanics (Socratic challenge, gray-area discovery, recommended-answer fatigue mitigation, soft quality gate) are universal indicators of a well-scoped greenfield project.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
